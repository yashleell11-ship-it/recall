/**
 * Fixture backend, enabled with NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK=1.

 * Not a stub: it holds mutable state for the lifetime of the tab, so grading a
 * card removes it from the queue (grade 1 pushes it back), approving pending
 * cards drains the triage list, and settings changes stick. That is what makes
 * it useful for building against while the Python API is being written.
 *
 * The numbers are meant to look like a real second-semester deck in week
 * eleven, not like a fresh install: 1,240 active cards, a 21-day streak, a
 * daily cap that today's load actually collides with.
