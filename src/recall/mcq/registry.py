"""Which subjects and units the curated bank covers, and how long a sitting is.

Declared here rather than derived from what happens to be in the bank, so a
unit with nothing written yet still appears on the picker with a count of 0
and a "waiting for material" note. A unit that vanishes from a screen because
nobody has written its questions is indistinguishable, to the student, from a
unit that does not exist. The same holds one level up: a subject with no
questions at all is still listed, every unit at 0, so the picker shows the
student the whole semester and which parts of it are still being written.

The unit numbers are the ones printed on the lecture decks, 1-based.

**Five of the six subjects are derived from `recall.lpu`, not retyped.** That
registry is where the LPU syllabus lives — read off the Session 2026-27 PDFs
and corrected against them — and a second hand-typed copy of the same unit
names here would drift from it the first time either one was fixed. So for
every subject except CSE111 the label is `SUBJECTS[code]["full_name"]` and the
units are `SUBJECTS[code]["units"]` numbered 1..6, computed at import. Fix a
unit name in lpu.py and the picker follows.

**CSE111 is the exception, and it is written out on purpose.** Its MCQ bank
was written against the photographed CA1 syllabus, whose two units are not
lpu.py's seven: "Computational Thinking & Computing Environment" and "Version
Control & Cyber Security Basics" group the course the way the CA was set, and
the 544 questions already in the live bank carry those unit numbers. Deriving
CSE111 from lpu.py would renumber every one of them.

#: rather than as an alphabetical list ("easy, hard, max, medium" is nonsense).
#:
#:   easy   — one fact, stated directly in the material.
#:   medium — telling neighbours apart: which-is-NOT, ordering, the near miss.
#:   hard   — applying the idea to a short realistic scenario.
#:   max    — the hardest FAIR tier: a trap-adjacent scenario, two concepts
