"""Reading the curated bank off disk, and refusing a malformed question.

The bank is JSON in the repository — one file per subject-unit under
`src/recall/mcq/bank/` — because a question is prose someone wrote and edited,
and prose belongs in a reviewable diff rather than in a table only SQL can see.
`recall.mcq.seed` is what puts it into the database.

Every rule below is enforced HERE, in Python, and nowhere in the schema: the
tables carry no CHECK constraints for the same reason `lessons` does not (see
the note above it in schema.sql), and a constraint would in any case only fire
at seed time, on the server, with a message nobody writing questions would see.
A ValueError here names the question's key and what is wrong with it, which is
the one thing the person fixing the file needs.
