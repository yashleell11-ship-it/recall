"""Yash Made Test routes. Thin over recall.mcq.service — logic lives there.

Three exception types, three statuses, and no fourth way of saying no:
`LookupError` -> 404 (including somebody else's attempt, which must be
indistinguishable from an id that never existed), `ValueError` -> 422,
`McqConflict` -> 409. Nothing here returns 200 with an error in the body.
